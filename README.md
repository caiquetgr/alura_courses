### What is this?

This repository is all about courses that I'm studiyng and practising in Alura's learning plataform. I'm keeping these studies in 
a repository mainly for having a place to consult and refresh my mind if needed, since I'm also studiyng some subjects that are not part of my
daily job as a Java Spring developer (like Javascript or Clojure).
